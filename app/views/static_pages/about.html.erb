			<h4>I’m Leah O’Connell and I have the best job in the world.</h4>
			<p>Once I discovered the joy I got from photographing children and families, I literally could not imagine myself doing anything else as a career.</p>
			<p>If you like yoga, board games, quaint boutique-y shops, a good cup-a-joe, turning back the pages of a book, or adventures in the great outdoors, chances are we could be friends! If you’re consistently grumpy, hate sunshine, or lack an understanding of sarcasm, chances are we could not.</p>
			<p>I am wife to the most wonderfully supportive husband named Matt who is also my business partner and web designer, (bonus!). We have an Australian Shepherd puppy named Bourbon and together we are just happily navigating life in all its glory!</p>
