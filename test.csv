6,Fast Food vs Fine Dining,"##The Decision-Making Complex

Have you ever sat down at a restaraunt, casually opened the menu, and suddenly found yourself with the overwhelming feeling like being buried back in 10th grade English class? If the menu has pages and pages of  options for me to scour before I make my choice, I'll probably start sweating a little and fidgiting like I have to pee every time the waiter starts walking toward my table. Ultimately, I end up flustered and just picking something completely random from the first 2 pages that has a picture with it and then having orderer's remorse the entire time I wait for my meal, wondering if I would have been better off with that other dish. Anybody else? 

In comparison, a specialty fine dining restaurant might only have a one page menu but every item on it is guarenteed to be exquisite. My decision is already narrowed down for me to the best of the best and I trust whatever I get will be delicious. You may be thinking, 

>Wow this girl is a hot mess, I'm definitely never doing dinner with *her*.

But I assure you, I am not really a food snob. I am simply trying to explain the thinking behind one of my business practices. Confused? I'll show you.

##Fine Dining Photography
If you schedule a regular session with Firefly Photography, when it comes time to sit down together and view your images at your ordering session, you will have 25 images from which to choose your artwork, prints, and anything else you want. It's true that I generally capture hundreds of images during your shoot. When I get them back to my workspace, though, I go through each and every one with scrutiny to find the best of the best. The sharpest focus, the best expressions, the most flattering pose. I spend 10-30 minutes, sometimes more, retouching each image for your final gallery to take it to the next level. I do that part ahead of time so that when you see your photos, you're not spending *your* time comparing duplicates, zooming in to check clarity, or separating all the images where someone's blinking. I do that. I like doing that, believe it or not. That's part of my job! I'm also not going to ""hide"" anything from you that I think you might want hanging on your wall or put in an album. I **want** you to have the **best** and you can trust that I'll put the time in behind the scenes so that what you see is just that. No sweating over making the right choice or worrying if you missed out on something great. Custom photography is like fine dining. Enjoy your meal, don't stress over it.

8,Why Firefly? ,"What do you think of when you hear the word, *firefly*?

+ I think of **summer nights**, running around the yard with my brothers.
+ I think of the **magical** touch of nature.
+ I think of **playfulness**.
+ I think of the country, tall grass, and **simplicity**. 
+ I see twinkling lights and space to **explore**.
+ I hear quick **footsteps** and **giggles**.
+ I feel nostalgic, **treasuring** a part of growing up and a piece of **home**.


When I started thinking more clearly about what I really want my photography to say and do for people, I realized my true desire was to spread those same feelings I feel when I think back on those nights of catching fireflies without a care. I want my clients to get that sense of **playfulness**, feel the **magic** of a special moment, enjoy and **explore** the beauty of our surroundings, step away from busy life for short time and **treasure** the little things. I want to provide people with moments worth capturing so that every day they walk into a room in their **home**, they can see the genuine faces of loved ones on their walls. They can pull a book off the shelf 20 years later and show a friend or grandchild what happiness looked like in a different season of life.

5,"Top ""gives and ""takes"" for new businesses ","To say that I’ve grown in my knowledge of photography and business over the past year would be an enormous understatement. That said, I can empathize even more now with good old Al when he spoke these words: 

 >“The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know.” -Albert Einstein. 

 Whenever I started to reflect on the steps and broke it all down, I realized that like all other relationships, the one between a dreamer and the dream requires a balance of give and take. 

Below, I’ve narrowed down some of the largest lessons I learned from my first year in business to the top 3 “gives and takes.” While I wrote under the scope of a growing a photography business, I think these tips could be adapted to fit any long term goal you might be striving towards. 

**Gives:**

1. **Give your clients your focus.**
When you put others, (their needs, wants, and happiness) as your focus and let those things drive your decisions, you will be blessed in turn by the result! Doing something just for you can be therapeutic, sure, but doing something for someone else is fulfilling. Think about it- how often do you see people participate in activities “in honor of” someone? They could just run 5 miles anytime for the heck of it, but placing someone or some cause as the focus of that run can power drive, awareness, and commitment to a whole community! The more you tie your own goals to a greater purpose, the more impact you will create all around. 
 
2. **Give your business your heart**.
The spark that starts it all will urge you forward, even when you come across pieces of the road that aren’t your favorite. There are pros and cons to every job, but the difference between being *able* to do something and *loving* what you do goes back to the heart. 

3. **Give yourself the tools you need to be successful**. 
Yes, you can give to yourself. Upfront investments, time, equipment, whatever it is you need to reach your goal, you *need those to reach your goal*. You can’t do things halfway and expect a full result. Sometimes it takes a lot more time that you want it to. Or money. Or work. But the truth remains: to be better you have to get better. And you have to give yourself a fair chance at it, too. 

**Takes:** 

1. **Take education seriously.** 
Wanting something badly enough does not make you good at it. You might start with some natural inclination and ability, but while passion is the core, it doesn’t get you very far without action to go along with it. Take your ability to learn and the gift of innumerable resources we have available in this world; take it into your own hands! Not everything is just going to come to you; sometimes you have to go out and find it for yourself. 

2. **Take advice and criticism with a grain of salt.** 
Guidance from others is precious and helpful, but just remember that you are unique (that’s a good thing) and what worked for them may not be right for you. Seek and learn from other people, but use those lessons to shape your own philosophies and solutions.

3. **Take every opportunity.** 
Sometimes, opportunity may come knocking before you feel ready; in those cases, act like you’re ready and go for it anyways. My business design, focus, market, products, (pretty much everything) has changed 4 times over the past year. Had I waited until finding just the right model to launch, though, I never would have discovered all the things from a business-in-action that ultimately developed a solid and complete vision. When opportunity comes knocking, you have to run towards it, not away. 

I hope that my own life lessons inspire you somehow to give and take a little more in your life today!

4,What to Wear For a Chilly Photoshoot,"Life doesn't freeze when the weather gets colder; we just have to adjust. That applies to your photoshoot, too. If you have the opportunity in your schedules to get family photos taken, there's a milestone that needs commemorating, or whatever the case may be, you don't have to wait until the trees are blooming and you can break out the sundresses for those pictures to be great. You just alter the vision! 

There are plenty of ways to get around location woes by shooting indoors or getting creative with your background, (for more on that, check out [this post](http://blog.leahoconnell.com/2013/10/out-of-box-locations.html)). But don't take the outdoors off your realm of possibilities just because it's chilly. Trust me, I am no fan of the cold and I'm sure that my Hawaii-aquainted-blood will be shocked by those winds come December, but even I can endure the cold for an hour, especially if we're running around and having fun like any of my typical sessions.

3,The Right Way To Do A Wall Gallery,"One of the things people love most about social media is the ability to show others around the world their photos. We get joy, as do others, from reminiscing and recounting pleasant memories and the smiles of our loved ones. So when an old friend comes to visit in person, or your grandkids want to see what their parents looked like at their age, or you want to be continually reminded of your favorite vacation spot, do you huddle around the computer and start clicking? Personally, I find it much more effective to just have those favorite images on display. Whether as wall art or an album on your coffee table, those memories are a readily accessible, tangible, part of your everyday surroundings. That being said, there is such thing as overkill.

Having a gallery wall doesn't mean you have to literally cover the full wall with your photos. Small images crowded together in large quantities among matting and framing and shapes and textures and sizes and .... yea it's overwhelming and actually distracting. Don't be afraid of size though, either; sometimes 1 really large image placed well can make much more of an impact that a whole wall of 5x7's and 8x10's. Below are some gallery wall designs that look classy and display photos in a way that they can be seen and enjoyed on a regular basis.

7,What to Wear- Warm Tones,"Another way you may think of organizing your look for a family shoot is by settling on generic tones, like pastels or jewel tones.

9,Beach Engagement Session,"One of my favorite things about photography is that every single session is different. When you work with kids, a little crazy is inevitable. It's also what makes it fun. Adults can be just as fun though, which I was reminded of this weekend when I had the opportunity to shoot and engagement session for George and Teri. These two have been together for 8 years, most of which has been long distance, so it was immediately clear to me how comfortable they were around one another. After just spending a few hours with this fun-loving couple, I can tell what a great match they make! Earlier in the week, Teri and I discussed some of their favorite things to do together and how to incorporate them in their photos, so by the end of the shoot when I asked how they thought it went, George responded with, 

> I got to play football, lay on the beach, drink bear, and eat cheesecake so yea, it was fun! 

Not to mention, we were set on one of the most gorgeous and famous beaches in the world, Sunset Beach on the North Shore. Local surfers and competitors from the Vans Surf Competition were catching waves and enjoying the beautiful conditions behind us the whole evening. This couple was definitely a drastic change from the toddlers I've been working with most recently, so thanks Teri and George for being so awesome and not requiring me to make a single animal noise the whole session!

27,Special Event Coming to Downtown Winchester! ,"One of my primary goals for the direction of my business is to provide clients with easily accessible opportunities to celebrate the unique and lovable qualities of their children: those special intricacies   and quirks, the things they love at a particular stage, where they are in their discovery of the world and their own personality. It's why letting her pick out her own outfit (even if it's pajamas and a princess crown) can sometimes be the best decision you make for your session. It's why letting him bring his favorite dinosaur toy to the session is not going to ruin the pictures, but instead, make it even cuter. 

This was the inspiration behind the organization of my upcoming Storybook Mini-Sessions. Books are a huge part of all kids' lives! Reading to kids at bedtime is one of the most special bonding moments between parents and their children. They always seem to pick out that one or two favorite story that, after a few months of reading it every night until the binding is tattered and worn, the child can recite word for word. There's that book she loves for it's pretty pictures. Or the first book he ever really **read**. The look of wonder followed by sheer excitement when she runs between the library shelves. Those are details worth capturing!

I am so grateful to The Winchester Book Gallery for agreeing to host a first-time Mini-Session event in their wonderful downtown location. The small, local store has a warm and welcoming feeling throughout and an adorable children's section on the upper level. Each session will hold a 30 minute time slot (between 9am and 5pm) in which we are able to let the child play, explore, and read their favorite stories while I capture every little perfect expression. We will have some storybook themed snacks and some warm beverages set up for you to enjoy while you're visiting as well. This will give you the unique opportunity to get out of the winter cold, enjoy a fun afternoon activity with your little one on the downtown mall, and get a taste of the beauty in custom, on-location, photography. Contact me if you are interested in booking a slot for your kiddo and I will be in touch asap to set you up with all the details!

10,3 Important Reasons For Pre-Consultations ,"If you’ve thought about booking a custom portrait session, you’ll notice that a full experience with Firefly Photography includes a one on one meeting before ever stepping in front of the camera. (see the process on [this page](https://www.lofirefly.com/process)) It may seem unnecessary at first, as in, 
>“Can’t we just email?” 

>“How much could there possibly be to talk about?” 

>“Don’t we just need to schedule a date and call it good?”

From my experience with families in the past and knowing the experience I want to offer my clients in the future, this pre-consultation is actually crucial! In fact, it basically sets up the success or failure of your shoot altogether. There is a whole lot more to getting great pictures than simply pointing and clicking the camera, (which is pretty underrated in itself, but that’s for another post.) I assume if you’re coming to me for photos, you want them to look effortlessly natural, put together, reflective of personality, and worth the money you’re investing, right? Well, here are my top 3 reasons that the pre-session consultation is so essential in the process :

###1. Friends vs. Strangers###

It’s hard to be yourself entirely around a perfect stranger, let’s be honest. It’s also hard to communicate personality through email or phone. I can’t possibly expect my clients to feel comfortable and natural around me (and my camera) if we know nothing about one another. Kids usually warm up a little more quickly, but they are also individuals who need, like, and dislike different things. If you want to avoid your child’s “cheeeeese” face, I have to know how to make them laugh, how to brighten their day, how to make pictures enjoyable instead of torture. I only get those details through conversation. Familiarity and comfort are not achieved through questionnaires and those are the most important factors to help me create an honest reflection through photography.  

###2. The particulars###
When planning something that requires multiple people to be in one place for a given time with the same intentions and expectations, a email chain to coordinate all that becomes annoyingly difficult to manage. An in-person meeting allows us to hash out all the details right at once – dates, times, locations, wardrobe, props, special details, what you hope to use the photos for, and whatever I can do to make it easier for you. All at once, boom, plan made. And you’ll probably get a free drink out of it, too, my treat. ☺ 

###3. Crystal Clear###
I try to be very open on my website and advertising about the kind of portraits I capture and the kind of experience I offer, but I’m aware that it may be new compared to what many people are used to. Getting together in person allows us to clear up any questions you may have about how I work, what you will be getting in turn, and how it will all unfold. Again, this is much easier to communicate through conversation. I don’t want there to be any surprises once we start working together, just open communication, advice, and help to get you to the final product: *a real portrayal of your loved ones as artwork in your home for you and others to cherish.*

11,"Modern Day ""Matching""","Style can make a huge difference in the sophistication of your photos. It's a fine line to walk between looking put together and looking like the next Stepford-family; you want everyone to like what they are wearing, but to let all parties go about dressing themselves with no regard to consistency would most likely end in disaster. So how you set parameters that are open enough to allow individual expression without opening the door for Halloween costumes and prom dresses in this year's family photo? 

##The Better Approach
The best way to please all (especially if you have teenagers who *really* don't appreciate being told what to wear) is to pick a few colors and let those be the only guideline. Traditionally, you might instigate the outfit organization with rules like,  
>Ok, everyone wear something red with khakis.

or

>We're all going to wear something solid in a shade of blue.

Instead, set a palette based off 3 or 4 colors in your home or any other inspiration and let the rest (pattern, texture, accessories, everything!) be open for interpretation! As long as the pieces stay within that palette, you are pretty much guaranteed to look great as a whole *and* avoid being all ""matchy-matchy."" Plus, you'll get a little personality from everyone as they choose pieces they really like and feel good in. Of course, if your toddler doesn't quite grasp colors yet, you might still be in charge of that outfit. But otherwise, don't be afraid to mix and match! 

##Try this!
For example, I chose the palette of colors above based on fabric from some curtains. All the outfit samples could be mixed and matched in different combinations and still look picture perfect because they fit into that palette. This also means that you don't necessarily have to go shopping to get the perfect outfits that match. Everyone is sure to have something in his/her closet that can compliment whatever palette you choose!

This arrangement would be the centerpiece of any room. The prints are large and stand out on the wall in an interesting arrangement, all together making an incredible impact.

###2. The framed favorites

Using simple matching mats and frames, treasured moments and details make the perfect artwork for a nursery or playroom. This monochromatic arrangement is classy and understated; it enhances the room without being overwhelming. So basically it's just gorgeous. 

###3. The modern flair

Squares are a very popular crop right now for photo display. The arrangement set in black and white squares gives a streamlined appearance of elegance without being stuffy. It's clean, fresh, and best of all, makes these kids' smiles the focal point of the room.

12,How To Adjust For Cold-Weather Sessions,"With the scent of ocean air in our noses and the sound of swaying palm trees still in our ears, my husband and I stepped off the plane in Philadelphia National Airport to a biting winter sting that was a slap in the face to our Hawaii-accustomed blood. Thankfully, the warmth of our family at Thanksgiving and the rest we feel entering this new stage of life is enough to overrule even icy windshields. Right away, I had the opportunity to photograph one of my very favorite families (I may be bias because they are related, but they really are great) as my inaugural east coast shoot for Firefly Photography. Soon into the shoot, I realized just how different this was, in more than the obvious ways, from shooting on the beaches of Oahu. I quickly picked up these few very practical tips to remember for my clients and myself that will help make cold weather shoots successful and fun. 

*Here are 3 most crucial things to remember before any cold weather shoot:*

##1. Know your location well and exactly where to set up.
Every second counts when you’re working with kids in the cold. Adults are more capable of, as my husband puts it, “sucking it up,” but when kids get cold, it’s just miserable and there’s no hiding it. Every minute you take walking around to scope and set up is part of the precious window where the kiddos are still able to embrace the chill. 

##2. Bundle doesn’t have to mean bulk. 
Of course, we don’t your crew looking like The Michelin Man’s family reunion, but it’s still important to include some cold-weather protection. A pair of gloves, a hat, a scarf, thick socks: those are all items that add warmth without bulk. They can also be a great way to add some texture and accent color to your wardrobe against jackets! Double bonus. 

##3. Nap time is the devil hour for photos. 
Ever been around a perfectly sweet kid and then, like the switch of a light at some point around 12:00pm, they transform into a kicking, clawing pile of tears? Yea, just avoid that middle of the day period. Earlier in the morning right after breakfast or late afternoon before the sun goes down, like around 3:00 or so, are generally your best bets. (By the way, the sun sets at like 5:00pm now! What in the world!?)


At the end of the day, there are some things for which you can’t prepare, anticipate, or change. That’s why it’s also important to just go with the flow and embrace the season, both in weather and in life. Families all have ups and downs but where there is love, there is always something beautiful to capture.

13,Current Loves,"In the spirit of Christmas and Carrie Underwood's recent revival of The Sound of Music, I thought I'd share a few of my favorite things. *(Anyone else not totally sold on that remake? I love Carrie, but I was a tad disappointed in the new chopped up version of the classic, sorry to say...)* Anyways, these items don't follow the ""raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens"" pattern, but they are some of my obsessions from the past month that I thought I'd share with you, just in case you're interested in also joining in on singing their praises. Or need a stocking stuffer. Or some general entertainment. In whatever manner, here's to hoping you find some purpose from my personal rave-worthy items. 

**1. Blue Diamond Nut-Thins:** delicious, crispy, healthy, flavorful, and a regular part of my lunch or snacking. 

**2. Whose Line is it Anyways:** My husband and I found a funny clip on YouTube that quickly spiraled into a 2.5 hour marathon (enhanced with wine) that made for a date night full of belly-rolling laughter. Definitely a winner for a cheap night in. 

**3. Flipboard:** I fell in love with this app because of it's clean, easy to navigate appearence and customizeable magazines to feature only the sort of news you're actually interested in reading. 

**4. Preveal:** My new FAVORITE tool for business. Though it's a bit pricy, it's specifically designed for professional photographers to showcase client's sessions for them to scale with pictures from their own home. It's an amazing tool to help clients see the potential of thier photos and plan gorgeous wall galleries with zero risk. LOVE IT. 

**5. Blue Peacoat from Jack by BB Dakota:** This is my favorite winter coat I've ever owned. It's slim and fitted but also super warm and a great color, too! I found it on ModCloth.com and was worried about the fit, but it was perfect. I love pretty much everything in this shop. 

**6. The Hunger Games- Catching Fire:** Have you seen it yet? It's A-Maze-Ing. Plus I'm mildly obsessed with Jennifer Lawrence alone so I'm a fan of whatever she's in. 

**7. Love Ring:** I love the simplicity of the design and pretty finish of the rose gold. This one is from Max and Chloe, but I've seen the general style as a trend from several other retailers as well. Cute accessory you could wear on the everyday occasion. 

**8. Christmas Coffee Blends:** I love the flavors of Christmas and all the brands now have their seasonal products out which makes me a happy girl. Doesn't have to be a latte or some fancy blended drink, just the regular brew but with that extra flavor of peppermint or pumpkin or gingerbread... yuuuuumm. I like to stock up on my favorites for a little Christmas in July as well :-)

14,Strategies for Getting Natural Expressions from Kids,"There is one word that makes modern photographers all over the world cringe. You may catch said photographer in a slow motion dive for any parent or assistant trying to helpfully ""control"" their child with this word during a session because in actuality, the uttering of such syllables together have the power to turn any session swiftly into a disastrous, snowballing failure of awkwardly forced images. 

Ok so that's a bit dramatic. 

Do you know the word, though? I bet we've all said it during a photo or two or twenty or a thousand in our lives, (including me!) You get the camera out, point it at the child to capture that precious moment, and you dutifully prompt him/her to,
>Say Cheeeeeeeeeese!!

The results typically tend to come out something like this: 

![fake expression kids photo session](http://media-cache-cd0.pinimg.com/originals/2e/5c/97/2e5c974ca57aee1cae163064cbbc6a67.jpg)

Now, Luke is a handsome kid, and very sweet as well. I know because he's my nephew ;-) Unfortunately, the ""cheese"" face does him no justice at all. That's why I use some alternate methods to get natural expressions, a little more like this: 

![natural expression kids photo session](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/a2/ed/ed/a2ededbdd8b41c751d68094a0ae994b1.jpg)

##1. 
These boys were, well, being boys. 3 boys. Brothers. Rowdy. I wasn't even going to attempt to make sit still and smile for the camera. It would undoubtedly end with them all squirming and probably throwing sand and making uncomfortable faces. No good. Instead, I asked them to show me their best ninja jump. (I, of course, demonstrated) On the count of three, they threw out a mighty karate chop and when they landed laughing, that's when we got the winner. 

![strategies for natural expressions with kids](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b8/b1/c0/b8b1c04626a1f7d1b7f7d1e319218b58.jpg)

##2. 
This one was the result of a game in which we all squeezed our eyes shut and on the count of 3, opened them and made our goofiest faces. Yes, the result is goofy faces when given such a prompt, but at least it shows some personality, right? Plus, it lets the kids relax and have fun, leading to even better pictures later.

##3.
A kid doesn't always have to be looking at the camera for it to be a good picture; in fact, many of my favorite shots have been candid. In the image below, playful Soli and her mom were tossing a little snowball I brought that happened to make her very happy! I captured the moments in-between the toss for her expression of pure joy and excitement!

When kids are having fun, their faces will show it. Cheese is not fun, therefore, I try to stay dairy free at all sessions.

15,A Furry Christmas,"When I make a change, it's usually drastic. I can readily admit I am not the best with decisions, but when I feel convicted about something, I've noticed it's usually sudden and relatively radical. Go big or go home. That's how it came to be that one week ago we got out first puppy.Meet the newest member of the Firefly team: Bourbon. 

![puppy for christmas](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e4/20/14/e42014b65f5694a7b579649ce0a69537.jpg)

Bourbon is an 2 month old Australian Shepherd, named after the bar at which my husband and I met called 'Bourbon Street' in Harrisonburg, VA. We have wanted a puppy for years and talked about it even while we were still dating, but long distance relationship and then our living arrangements in Hawaii made that impossible thus far. We didn't know exactly what kind we wanted or when we would decide it was the best time to bring him home, but we knew a puppy was in our near future. 

When we recently moved to begin the newest, military-less, stage of our lives together, the possibility became more real. As we held this pup for the first time and played with him, we knew something was different; we both basically fell in love with him immediately. Even though one could argue there is never a 'right' time to get a dog, (just as they say about having kids as well, ironically) we went with our instincts and went home that day with our new pup. 

Needless to say, this drastic change probably explains why I've been a little quieter on social media and the blog lately. Owning a puppy is no walk in the park, if you pardon the pun. Luckily, this was no grand surprise. He's learning quickly as we train him to go to his crate, use the potty outside, not bite peoples' clothing or people themselves for that matter... you know, all those things that puppies do. He really is a great dog though all in all and we are so happy to have him, excited to watch him grow, and looking forward to bonding with him over the years. 

I always wanted a puppy for Christmas but thought better of asking; finally at 24 years old my wish was finally able to come true. Merry Christmas to you all and I hope you are enjoying your holiday season just as joyfully! ",2013-12-17 14:57:48.330703,2013-12-17 15:00:27.98846,"When I make a change, it's usually drastic.

16,My Most Memorable Images from 2013,"## Personal and Professional 
2013 was full of big decisions, life-changing risks, big moves towards unknown results. It's simultaneously thrilling and terrifying to make these leaps as a 20-something that will effect your future drastically. Luckily, I do not have to make them alone, as I have an amazingly supportive, insightful, and dedicated husband who is crucial in every step. Together, 2013 brought us 4 overseas deployments and safe returns.It brought us the decision to focus my business and develop my craft for a target demographic of children and families. It brought us the decision to step away from life with the military and move towards new career opportunities. It brought us new friends, new adventures, new goals, and new dreams. It brought me inspiration to brand, re-brand, and brand again untill finally, everything clicked and L.O. Photography became Firefly Photography. I am still wondering if it's true that this dream of mine continues to become more of a reality.

A lifestyle shoot means mostly candid shots, more natural interaction instead of posing. With some natural light coming in from windows and doors nearby, your own home can become the perfect staging.

20,"Minor Changes, Big Impact","###Retouching Gone Wild###
Photoshop gets a bad rap among the general population because of magazine editors who take their enhancements to the extreme. It's true that you CAN use it to alter body shapes, enlarge or shrink features, remove imperfections, and much more. In my opinion, that's pretty messed up. Isn't the point of a photograph to capture realistic, natural insight to a person, place, thing, or experience? If that image is altered to an extreme, it's no longer genuine. You may as well have a painting; it is crafted, not captured. Now, if the intent of the shoot is a conceptual piece, something that's not intended to represent reality, Photoshop is an incredible and almost limitless tool for artists that allows them to create work to stretch the imagination to gorgeous new places. This is not the intent, however, with portrait photography, especially for a market of everyday people to display in their homes. 

###Subtle Uses###
So here's what may or may not be a shocker considering my previously expressed ideas- I still use Photoshop techniques to enhance every one of my images for a client gallery. There **is** such a thing as middle ground when it comes to retouching! I believe it's what can take a good photo and make it stunning. It's *part* of the difference between snapping a photo with a nice point-and-shoot camera and your professional photo session. It's the extra mile that your photographer takes to take your images to the next level while still maintaining the personal nuances that give us character and make us real! It's what allows you to celebrate the image itself and the emotion within it, rather than focusing on those stray hairs or a stubborn zit. It can be as simple as adding a color effect or changing the hue of the lighting. When it comes to Photoshopping, a little can go a long way to making your images pop. It certainly takes skill to manipulate entire images, bodies, backgrounds, and props, but it takes a different kind of skill to recognize the line and make subtle, natural adjustments to delight clients without altering (too much) of reality.

It's true that you CAN use it to alter body shapes, enlarge or shrink features, remove imperfections, and much more. In my opinion, that's pretty messed up. Isn't the point of a photograph to capture realistic, natural insight to a person, place, thing, or experience? If that image is altered to an extreme, it's no longer genuine.

21,Indoor Location Inspiration ,"Sure, setting up on a sunny summer day in the park is typically a safe bet for some nice family photos, but where's the fun in that? Lifestyle photography is becoming more and more popular as a way to capture real emotions and real character, and also opens tons of doors for interesting and unique locations that aren't so seasonally exclusive. I recently went with my nephews and niece on a playdate to the bowling alley, a place that is definitely not somewhere one would describe as scenic; still, I was excited to capture their cute little smiles in an artistic way and have the memories of this special day with more than a blurry picture from my phone.

22,Reflection on a Quiet Day,"**Solitude.** The ticking of an antique clock. The sun beaming through the window while the wind whips sheets of fallen snow. The puppy is content and asleep. My coffee is fresh and steaming. Little moments are my happiness lately.

There are seasons in life composed of wild change, drastic highs and painful lows. And then there’s this. Steady. It feels strange coming off a period of extremes and excitement into a stint of uncertainty. I am unsure of what the next few months will or will not bring and what I should or shouldn’t be bringing to them. I think (and hope) many other 20-somethings can relate to this feeling of anxiety about current choices and how they will affect our lives. It’s so common today to be constantly driving toward the ""right"" job, the ""right"" degree, the ""right"" lifestyle, the ""right"" relationships, that when we actually have time to sit in the quiet and listen to life happening, it feels wrong. **Like failure.** Like wasted time. At least it does for me. 

But fortunately, sometimes there is also clarity in those little quiet moments. There is clarity about the blessings, beauty, and bounty all around me. If I let them, they even rejuvenate me and lend a reset button for my creativity and my confidence. If I let them, they can also do the opposite. Even in the quiet there are decisions to make and emotions to consider. 

**It’s much easier to allow negative in than to put positive out.** But did you ever realize that doubt, fear, and worry are all choices? Challenges not only shout for motivation, perseverance, dedication, or passion, but sometimes for patience, acceptance, humility, or openness. Whether it is loud and sure, or just a whisper, happiness is determined by how we meet and respond to each call. Every moment has it’s purpose.

23,January Senior Session,"Right before the storm of the year hit us here on the east coast, packing 8inches of snow and single digit temperatures, we lucked out with some sun and a 40 degree afternoon for this handsome seniors' session. Just because he happens to be my cousin doesn't make me bias at all. Maybe a little. But I still think he did an awesome job keeping his spirits high and playing along with my bad jokes and random comments.

Guys are a little more difficult to shoot than girls, especially as they get older, because they tend to be less comfortable in front of the camera. In general, they seem to just take a little more time to loosen up. My favorite part about senior shoots is to just see both guys and girls slowly tune in more to the shoot; it takes usually 20 minutes or so, but eventually, we both become more connected and it shows in the images.

24,The Purpose of Printing,"###Why Print?

In our current day, there are so many ways to get your photos into books. Some are better than others, but the truth is, it's a step that often gets brushed aside and forgotten. Those photos of special moments and milestones end up packed in files on a computer or just posted on social media and lost among the millions of other photos stored there. The digital system is great for sharing, but flawed in its ability to finish the reason we take pictures in the first place. Whether from your personal camera on a regular day or professional images, you want those pictures to live on and be seen in 10, 20, 50, 100 years from now. You want to relive the joy of the moments simply by picking up a book on the coffee table or off the shelf and flipping the pages. Anytime, anywhere, in an instant, those moments are at your fingertips. What a wonderful gift that is! Still, so many of our precious moments exist only in pixels and easily erased with the click of a button.

###The Burden###
I understand that life is fast. Moments are fleeting. Finding the time to gather, compile, and print photos often gets lost in the shuffle. For this reason, whether it's a Shutterfly book, a collection of slotted pages in binder, a scrapbook, or a fully personalized leather-bound album, I applaud anyone who has taken that last step and put those photos into the hands of future generations. It used to be the only option before digital. Photos ended up stacked in boxes and scattered around drawers. Even still, when I come across those random piles in my parents' home every once in a while, I smile seeing that family member 30 years younger or reminicsing about old birthday parties and roller-skating outside with the neighbor kids. Now that (mostly) everything is digital, snapshots to professional sessions, those piles have turned to bottomless folders on the computer. They are even less likely to be stumbled upon or shared unless crowded around a screen. 

###Whose job is it anyway?###
Part of the cost in hiring a professional photographer, in my opinion, should include the time and stress of compiling, organizing, ordering, designing, and printing your photos to look and display their best. That's why now that I'm working in the photography industry, I also make it my business to **take that burden from people** and make long-lasting photos in print as simple as possible. The job should not stop after the flash goes off. You know, like when your photographer gives you a CD of the pictures, says thanks for the business, the rest is up to you? At that point, the process is only half done! The most important part comes in finalizing those images and getting them quickly into your hands to enjoy! My clients expect and recieve the whole package from start to finish. 

Less stress for you = more smiles for you = more time for more happy moments in your life. 

Your happiness = my happiness. We all win!

If you're making the investment for a professional photographer, make sure it is worth it from start to finish.

####Old School####
*These are the 80's-90's versions of albums, including my baby book! My parents have a cabinet of started books that were never finished and then boxes and boxes of miscilaneous prints. I am so thankful for all of it, though, because even what little was put together is such an amazing way to learn and see the story of my childhood, remember things that got pushed back in my memory, and feel the love of family over the years. There is nothing better! Though I don't know how she did it with three of us goons running around non-stop, but I'm so glad that my mom has those pictures. Don't let a busy life keep you from capturing memories of your family! Let me help! :)*",2014-01-27 19:21:45.365053,2014-01-27 19:22:59.882868,"###Why Print?###

26,All I Need To Know About Love...,"Today is Valentines Day, which, to be honest, doens't really mean a whole lot. It is, however, a day in which our society chooses to celebrate love and I **love** love so I also enjoy playing along. I was thinking back to all the Valentines Days past, with whom I spent them, how they played out, and it made me realize just how much I've grown in my understanding of relationships throughout it all. And at the same time, with all the drama, the secret crushes, the bad relationships, and break-ups in between, all that growth whittles down to a few extremely basic lessons that I learned at the beginning.  Ok, so maybe not like toddler stage, but at least in middle school when I first started caring. Even now in marriage, the heart of happiness seems to rest on very simple principles. If, according to author Robert Fulghum, ""All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten,"" then I propose that:

25,What's New With Firefly,"Winter is a tricky time to be an on-location photographer. I mean, lets face it, **no one** wants to be outside when it's 5 degrees outside +wind chill, especially kids. It just doesn't work. On the positive side, this lull in sessions is giving me the opportunity to focus my efforts on successful business practice, development, organization, and future planning. It's also giving me a chance to take on some first time projects I've been wanting to tackle that will boost my skill, confidence, and credibility as a photographer. 

###Up to Something

####Planning
Currently, I'm working on planning and orchestrating two big projects. The first is a collaborative shoot with 2 local business, [Cupcake Novelties](http://cupcakenovelties.webs.com/) and [Cloverdale Barn](http://www.cloverdalebarn.com/) of Winchester, VA. We are joining forces to style a chic children's party with an Easter theme to use as seasonal promotion for each business and also to submit so blogs, magazines, and other puplications for more widespread exposure. It's going to be absolutely adorable. With gorgeous sweet treats provided by Cupcake Novelties and the rustic glam backdrop from Cloverdale Barn, these kids will have a blast playing and eating together while I happily snap away at all the magic! This is the vision board I created to inspire our decor and overall design: 
![](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/f0/9c/cd/f09ccd40420a0fbb98ac230e6b617780.jpg)
*(Note: I claim none of the individual photos in this board as my own work; they were pulled from public pinterest links.)*


In order to get the session out in time for Easter promotions, we have to shoot in early March; we're just praying for some warmer weather to compliment our look or else we'll be hiding Easter eggs in piles of snow! Stay tuned for more insights as the planning comes together to form this great shoot. 

I'll save the reveal of my second project for a later post. ;-)
####Shooting
Most recently, I was able to shoot a very special event, as well as attend as a guest. (It was only *slightly* confusing to mesh between work and play, but definitely do-able, especially with a few glasses of Pinot) The event was a 70th birthday party, thrown by her immediate family, in honor of my grandmother Carole. It was a lovely day and people from all stages of her life came to celebrate with her. 
![](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/61/65/58/61655835c8851a914c850ec5719d7ed2.jpg)

####Reading
I am always trying to learn more and discover the best ways to opperate a small business, grow it successfully, and run it smoothly. I recognize that 

>1. The backbones of a successful business do not come naturally to me.
>2. I *do* enjoy learning how to make my dreams come true
>3. When my dreams come true, I'll be able to make lots of other people happy.
>4. Setting up an organized, efficient, and moral business is the key to actually being able to enjoy what I love most about this career in the first place: the photography and the people! 

I'm finding [this book](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2086680_2086683_2087664,00.html) is a great source for teaching that mindset of setting the business foundation properly and recommend it to anybody who is maybe considering starting a business of their own.

28,Why I Specialize... (in something other than weddings),"Whenever I say ""I'm a photographer,"" 9 times out of 10 the immediate response I get is, ""oh, do you do weddings?"" 

It's a legitimate response, considering that people will always be getting married, wanting beautiful photographs of the day, and willing to pay for quality coverage of every once-in-a-lifetime detail. From a business perspective, if you're going to jump on the risky bandwagon of an art-focussed career, wedding photography is probably the safest bet in terms of profitability. So why did I choose otherwise? 

###To Clarify: 
First of all, I want to be clear that I am in absolutely no way bashing wedding photography with this post! I respect and admire photographers in all industries for honing the varying areas of expertise required in their genres. Whether it's commercial, newborn, fashion, food, real estate, family, or any other field, photographers need special training and abilities to succeed.  Weddings just happen to be what the mind instinctively jumps to whenever one mentions photography. Let's be honest, everyone has a camera today so if being a photographer were just a matter of pointing and clicking at any and everything, it wouldn't even count as a profession. But it is a profession- one that has supply and demand, can be profitable, and can be competitive. I think it's important to highlight the fact that photography (as a full-time profession) is not a 'one size fits all' model. For those of you who watch Modern Family, just because Mitchell works in environmental law doesn't mean he's quite cut out for all matters of legal trouble. In other words, just because someone is a 'doctor' doesn't mean you should go to them to fix your broken leg, give you medicine for your flu, and perform your lung transplant. Get the picture? (ha, I do love puns)

###In the beginning...
When I lived in Hawaii, I was fortunate enough to assist on several high-profile weddings with a well-established photographer who showed me the ropes and let me glimpse behind the scenes of her workflow. (You can check out Laura's work [here](http://lauraaguonphotography.com/main.html), she is a super talented photographer, make-up artist, and all around awesome lady!) I also assisted a few smaller ceremonies, beach vow renewals, and eventually even booked a few of my own wedding clients. As much as I love weddings, the excitement surrounding them, and the vision of love in general, my experience behind the lens only proved to me how vastly different the lifestyle of photographers can be depending on their specialty. It's not just weddings, either. I worked with photographers who shot kids birthday parties, who were commissioned for business head shots, and some who worked with fashion models for editorials. They all require a different personality, business approach, skill set, time commitment, and shooting style.   

That may seem a bit bizarre, and you probably even know a few photographers who shoot a wide variety of subjects. They probably have their own reasons for that choice, and it may even work for them, but that's really none of my concern. My concern rests on what I know about my own talent and interest, the kind of people with whom I choose to surround myself, and the life I want to lead in my career and independent of it. The business I am building will revolve around those choices, as do most decisions people make involving their careers. We ask ourselves, 

>What kind of impression do I want to make? 
  Who do I want to work with?
  What would I like to come from this job?
  How will this effect the people around me & the people I love?

Photographers in every genre will have different answers to these questions. It's not up to me to speculate their answers, though I could probably make some pretty accurate assumptions. My own answers, however, have led to me to specialize specifically and exclusively on families and children. In fact, when I say, ""I'm a photographer,"" what I really mean to say, (and probably should say) is, 

>I capture personality-driven portraits of lively interactions for families who cherish love and the fun in life. 

###Bottom Line
So no, I don't shoot weddings. 
I also don't shoot beautifully plate cuisine or rock concerts or car shows.

There are people who do all of those things very well. I could be one of them if I wanted to. I could click away at whatever brings in the bucks, sure. Instead, I choose to become excellent at something I love than survive on lots of different things I can manage.

29,How To: Find the Right Photographer for YOU,"Over the past 10 years, big-box-studios have slowly trickled out of business and out of public favor, only to be replaced by the growing popularity of custom photography. Consequently, consumers have more and more choices apart from theme-y backdrops and stiff poses. Personalization is the trademark of the 21st century; practically everything now can be customized exactly to our liking, including photography. If you're like me, though, sometimes too many choices can be a little overwhelming. So with so many photographers offering so many different styles, products, experiences, and price ranges, how are you supposed to sort out what you actually need/want in order to be happy with the end result? 

It's an important decision after all because that end result lives on for generations. How do you want to be seen 50 years from now when your grandkids look at those photos? What do you want to remember about your kids at this age? Here are a few questions you should ask yourself when looking for a photographer **before** your hire him/her. 

###1. What kinds of photos do I like? 

Ok, so I realize this may seem like an obvious one, but it's crucial! Every custom photographer is different and now that you have the **choice** about getting what you want, you should take a look around and figure out what style you like best! Some people take what's called a *lifestyle* approach in which sessions are completely candid peeks into everyday life. Often, these sessions take place in your home and capture everyday happenings for a very raw and real approach. Do you like more direction? Do you like dramatic lighting effects or soft and creamy sunlight? Do you prefer vibrant color or matte finishes? Spend some time browsing around sights like Pinterest and pulling pictures that really stand out to you and make you **feel** something.

###2. What do I want to DO with my photos? 

If you just want photos to stick in a box so you can check ""family photos"" off the to-list, you probably don't need to hire a professional in the first place. Otherwise, think of the impact you want them to have now and later. 

 - Is there a glaringly empty wall in your living room that could use some nice artwork? (Is there any better art than the smiles of your own kids??!)

 - A pretty album of your kids might be the perfect present for grandma...

 - How about some updated frames for the bookcase? 

And while you're thinking about that, 

 - Do you value higher quality products & custom pieces?

 - Do you have an eye for design to pick the best options and displays? 

It's important to keep in might the extent to which you want to display and preserve your photos when choosing your photographer because of how he/she can assist you in making that happen. Which brings us to the next question.

###3. How much time am I willing to invest in this process? 
Your personal time and effort in the process of having photos organized, taken, printed, and displayed is drastically affected depending on what photographer you choose. It can be a long, sometimes complicated, often frustrating undertaking amidst everyday life, one that often gets pushed to the bottom of the list and forgotten. If that's a familiar scene to you, you should recognize that fact and find a photographer who's job description includes taking care of all of that for you. This is probably where custom photography businesses differ the most. You can find photographers who will 
a. simply meet you at a location, snap some pictures with a nice camera, then give you the CD of images and leave you to the rest. 

b. plan everything from your wardrobe to the location for you, retouch every image with professional software and skill, then meet with you to custom design the best products for your needs and budget and hand-deliver them to you with a smile

There is, of course, lots of middle ground between these two options and the personality, efficiency, and quality care of your photographer can make or break either. The bottom line for this question, however, is in order to have a positive experience with your session from start to finish, you need to be honest about what you are willing to invest from your personal life in order to get products you and your relatives can enjoy in a timely fashion.

###How often will I have photos taken? 
Every 6 months? Every year? Every few years? Is this a once in a lifetime thing? For budgets and for planning, this is important to recognize! Some photographers offer packages that will save you money for your loyalty. This is a great thing for kids, too because they will feel more and more comfortable around that crazy person behind the lens each time you return. Sticking with one person also means you know what to expect, can form a friendly working relationship, and if you like the results, that's even less stress off your plate. If it's your first venture into custom photography, all these benefits are even more reason to get it right the first time.

###What kind of person do I like working with? 
Maybe this seems unrelated, but trust me, it's not. No matter what kind of photographer you choose and how little or how much they are involved in the process from start to finish, there is bound to be a good amount of communication via email, phone, and in person. Everything is more pleasant if you actually **like** the person to whom you're speaking. What kind of vibe do you get when you communicate? (And yes, you definitely should have some communication before any money is exchanged.) 

 - Do you feel at ease asking questions? 

 - Do you feel like you can be yourself around him/her?

 - Do you share a similar sense of humor? Does he/she *have* a sense of humor?!

 - Do you feel like you can trust him/her? 

 Remember, this person is going to be working with your kids, with your personal life, maybe even in your home. Liking your photographer and trusting his/her values is just as important as the quality of his/her work.

 Hopefully these questions will help you feel more prepared for your first or next custom photography experience. Choice is a great thing as long as you are educated about your options!

Consequently, consumers have more and more choices apart from theme-y backdrops and stiff poses. Personalization is the trademark of the 21st century; practically everything now can be customized exactly to our liking, including photography. If you're like me, though, sometimes too many choices can be a little overwhelming. So with so many photographers offering so many different styles, products, experiences, and price ranges, how are you supposed to sort out what you actually need/want in order to be happy with the end result?

###Scene: 

I looked over the lip of my freshly brewed mug of coffee at my computer screen, ready to tackle another item on my to-do list, when the wishful eyes of my puppy gazing out the window caught my eye. A deep breath and a peak out the window revealed a vibrant blue sky and calmness about the afternoon as the sun glimmered over a bed of untouched snow in my backyard. It was too beautiful not to capture and too perfect to be fair. The solution? 

A pup, a girl, and her camera.
